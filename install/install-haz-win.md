## How to install Home on Windows

Home Accountz requires **Oracle Java 8** (not Open JDK) in order to run.

4. Download the program from here:   
   <https://github.com/accountz-open/download/releases/download/21.07.19/home_install_210719.zip>
5. Open the zipped folder 
6. Drag the `home` folder onto your desktop and open it
7. Open the `bin` folder
8. Double click on the relevant file to you:  
   `runWin` 

   ![haz install windows](haz-install-win.jpg)
   
9. You will get a Windows message about it being an unrecognized application. 
9. Click More Info
