## How to install Business on Windows

Business Accountz requires **Oracle Java 8** (not Open JDK) in order to run. 

1. Download the correct Java for your operating system. Follow the instructions to install Java: <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html>
3. Download the program from here:   
   <https://github.com/accountz-open/download/releases/download/beta_21.07.09/baz_install_210709.zip>
5. Open the zipped folder you just downloaded
6. Drag the `baz` folder onto your desktop
7. Open the `bin` folder
8. Double click on the relevant file to you:  
   `runWin`  

   ![baz install windows](baz-install-win.jpg)

9. You will get a Windows message about it being an unrecognized application. 
9. Click More Info  

   ![baz unidentified -windows](baz-unidentified-win.jpg)

9. Select Run anyway

   ![confirm security windows](confirm-security-win.jpg)
   
9. Double click `runWin` again to open Business Accountz
9. To run the program each time go back to step 5. Or you could create a shortcut of the `runWin.bat`
